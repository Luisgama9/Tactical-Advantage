# 3D Tactical Board for Football Coaches

## Project Description

This project aims to create an innovative software solution for football coaches, enabling the creation, simulation, and analysis of game tactics in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. The software will be modular, expandable, and designed for desktop use, with plans to evolve into mobile applications (Android and iOS) in the future.

## Main Features

### Visuals & UI
- Responsive 3D pitch with defined zones: defensive, middle, and offensive.
- Players represented as 3D models with numbers and names.
- Menu with tabs for the 5 game phases.
- Modes:
  - **11x11**: Full simulation.
  - **By sector**: Work in specific field areas (defense, midfield, attack).
- Play control buttons:
  - ⏸️ Pause
  - ▶️ Play
  - ⏹️ Stop
- "Edit" button to configure trajectories, place the ball, and create set plays.

### Play Features
- Custom plays designed by the user (passes, runs with/without the ball).
- Step-by-step execution:
  1. Ball moves.
  2. Players move.
  3. Ball arrives at its destination.
  4. Pause for the next action.
- Save, edit, and combine plays into complex sequences.
- AI continues plays when user-defined instructions end.

### AI and Game Engine
- Game engine with physics-based movement.
- Opponent AI:
  - **Pre-season**: Adaptive AI.
  - **Season**: Fixed tactical AI.
- Configurable playing styles:
  - Possession-based.
  - Direct play.
  - Counter-attacking.
- AI makes alternative decisions if coach instructions are unfeasible.

### Data Management
- Export tactics and plays in formats:
  - **XML**: For integration with other software.
  - **PDF, Image, GIF, MP4**: For visual presentations.
- Import external tactics.
- Internal system for managing plays and tactic versions.

### Extras and Future Plans
- Modular design for easier expansion.
- Offline sharing between coaches.
- Visual exports for presentations.
- Lightweight AI training mode.
- Support for multiple tactics and simulations per user.
- Mobile adaptation in the future.

## Recommended Technologies

- **3D Graphics Engine**: Unity (C#) or Unreal Engine (Blueprints or C++).
- **3D Modeling**: Blender for custom models.
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage of plays and tactics.
- **Data Export**: Tools for generating XML, PDF, and video files.
